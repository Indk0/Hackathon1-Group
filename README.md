# QuizNinja

## Overview
QuizNinja is a ninja-themed web based quiz where users enter as a young ninja and can test their knowledge on topics such as 'Capital Cities'. At the end of the quiz, our Sensei awards you with a belt dependant on your performance. Typically, the better the score the darker the built!

## User Stories
Our user stories can be located at [QuizNinja Project Board](https://github.com/users/Indk0/projects/5/views/1 "QuizNinja Project Board").

We have utilised the [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method "MoSCoW") method of prioritisation to drive focus and ensure we deliver incremental value. The project board shows the prioritisaton by means of labels.

## Design Decisions
A sunset colour-theme was chosen to reflect the colours used in the background image, with orange being the primary colour used for buttons, icons and the favicon. We believe this gives the most authentic view of a dojo.
